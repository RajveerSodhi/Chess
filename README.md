My second chess program!

I first created an in-console chess program using Python in senior year of high school to challenge myself to solve complex problems using my beginner understanding of the language and coding in general. I created this program next a year later after student Java at university for 2 semesters. This was a much better and more organized program than my first attempt due to my increased experience with programming and knowledge of more concepts such as OOP.

I am keen to see how I can advance my program more once I learn further programming concepts. I hope to soon create a full-fledged, user-interface enabled chess program!
