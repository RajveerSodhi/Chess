# In-Console Chess

### Program Last Updated: May 2023

This is the second in-Console chess program I have created after [this](https://github.com/RajveerSodhi/Class-12-Chess).

I first created a chess program using Python in senior year of high school to challenge myself to solve complex problems using my beginner understanding of the language and coding in general. I created this program a year later after studying Java at UBC in my first year. This was a much better and more organized program than my first attempt due to my increased experience with programming and knowledge of more concepts such as OOP. I wrote this code to not only track my progress as a programmer, which is visible in the efficincy and organization in this code compared to that of my first program, but also to test whether I completely grasped all the concepts I was taught in class.

I am keen to see how I can advance my program more once I learn further programming concepts.

The program is fully function as-is, however, plesae do read the Issues section before using it to understand the current drawbacks.
