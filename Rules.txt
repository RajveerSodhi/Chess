=== Game rules are as follows: ===

— Goal of the Game:
Putting the opponent's king in a checkmate - a position from which
it is impossible to escape attack from your pieces.

--- General Rules: ---

- White always moves first. Movement is required.
- With the exception of the knight, a piece may not move over any of the other pieces.
- When a king is threatened with capture (but can protect himself/escape), it’s called check.
- If a king is in check, then the player must eliminate the threat and cannot leave the king in check.
- If a player isn't under check but has no legal moves, the game is in stalemate and ends in a draw.
- Checkmate happens when a king is in check with no legal move to escape. This ends the game.

--- Movement Rules: ---

- King can move one vacant square in any direction. It may castle once per game.
- Queen can move any number of vacant squares in any direction.
- Rook can move any number of vacant squares vertically or horizontally. It also is moved while castling.
- Bishop can move any number of vacant squares in any diagonal direction.
- Knight can move one square along any rank/file and then 2 perpendicularly. Its movement can also be viewed as an L.
- Pawns can move forward one vacant square. If not yet moved, it may move 2 vacant squares.
  It cannot move backward. It kills diagonally forward. It can also perform en passant and promotion.
- En Passant occurs when a pawn is moved 2 squares on its initial movement.
  The opponent can take the moved pawn “en passant” as if it had only moved one square,
  but only in the very next move from this opponent's play.
- If a pawn reaches the opponent's edge of the table, it  may be promoted to a queen, rook, bishop or knight.
- During the castling, the king moves two squares towards the rook he intends to castle with,
  and the rook moves to the square through which the king passed.
  Castling is only permissible if neither king nor rook involved in castling may have
  moved from the original position and there are no pieces between the rook and king.
  The king may not currently be in check.

=== Program rules are as follows: ===

- Enter coordinates of pieces by first mentioning the row and then the column (without any spaces) and press 'return'.
  Capitalization does not matter.
  For example: 2g, 4E, 8f, 1D
- If a player's king is under checkmate, or if he wishes to give up, he may type in "resign" where he is
  asked to enter the coordinates of the piece he wants to move.
- If you wish to go back to selecting the initial coordinates of the piece, type "back"
  where you are to type in the new coordinates.
- If a game ends in a draw, any of the players can enter "draw" where he's asked to enter the coordinates of
  the piece he wants to move. This call for draw will require a confirmation from the other player.
  If the other player does not agree, the game will continue.
- If there is a stalemate, the game will automatically end in a draw.
- These rules can be viewed any time by typing "rules" where players are asked to enter coordinates of the piece to move.
